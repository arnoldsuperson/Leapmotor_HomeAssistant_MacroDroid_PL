# Leapmotor to Home Assistant Integration

This is a fork of 2ZZ/Leapmotor_HomeAssistant_MacroDroid repo that works with polish version of the app.
It's mostly configured to support T03. Note that sensors are in english but actual strings from the app are in Polish, It's up to the user to change everything to suit themselves. NO SUPPORT IS GIVEN FOR ANY AND ALL ISSUES.

-------------------

This project provides a MacroDroid-based integration to sync Leapmotor vehicle data to Home Assistant. Since Leapmotor doesn't provide an official API, this solution uses screen scraping via MacroDroid on Android to extract vehicle information and push it to Home Assistant via the REST API.

## Overview

The integration consists of three main components:

1. **MacroDroid Macro** - Runs on your Android device to scrape the Leapmotor app and send data to Home Assistant
2. **Home Assistant Sensors** - Template sensors that extract attributes from the main sensor
3. **Home Assistant Dashboard** - A pre-configured Lovelace dashboard to display vehicle information

## Features

The integration tracks the following vehicle data:

- Vehicle state (parked, driving, etc.)
- Battery percentage
- Lock state (locked/unlocked)
- Remaining range (km)
- Average kWh/100km
- Total mileage

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **Android Device** with [MacroDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arlosoft.macrodroid) installed
- **Leapmotor App** installed and logged in on the same Android device
- **Home Assistant** instance (local or cloud accessible)

### Required Home Assistant Add-ons/Integrations (Only if using custom dashboard)

- [Custom Layout Card](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card) (HACS)
- [Mushroom Cards](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) (HACS)
- [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card) (HACS)
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) (HACS)

## Installation

### Step 1: Set Up Home Assistant

#### 1.1 Create Template Sensors

Add the contents of `.yaml` files to your Home Assistant configuration.

```yaml
# Add to configuration.yaml
template: !include template.yaml
input_text: !include helpers_input_text.yaml
input_number: !include helpers_input_number.yaml
```

Then place all `.yaml` files except `dashboard.yaml` in your Home Assistant config directory.

#### 1.2 Create a Long-Lived Access Token

1. In Home Assistant, click your profile (bottom left)
2. Scroll to "Long-Lived Access Tokens"
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Name it "MacroDroid Leapmotor"
5. Copy the token and save it securely (you'll need it for MacroDroid setup)

#### 1.3 Restart Home Assistant

After adding the sensor configuration, restart Home Assistant to load the new sensors.

### Step 2: Configure MacroDroid

#### 2.1 Import the Macro

1. Download `Leapmotor_to_HomeAssistant.macro` to your Android device
2. Open MacroDroid
3. Tap the menu (three dots) → "Import"
4. Select the downloaded `.macro` file

#### 2.2 Configure Variables

After importing, you need to configure three local variables:

1. Tap the macro to edit it
2. Tap "Variables" (at the bottom)
3. Configure the following **local variables**:

   - **`ha_url`** (Secure): Your Home Assistant URL

     - Examples:
       - Local: `http://homeassistant.local:8123`
       - Nabu Casa: `https://abcdefgh.ui.nabu.casa`
       - Custom domain: `https://home.yourdomain.com`
     - ⚠️ **Do not** include trailing slash

   - **`ha_token`** (Secure): The Long-Lived Access Token from Step 1.2

#### 2.3 Test the Macro

1. Make sure your device is unlocked and the Leapmotor app is logged in
2. In MacroDroid, tap the macro
3. Tap "Test Actions" (not "Test Macro")
4. Observe the macro running:

   - It will open the Leapmotor app
   - Wait for the home screen to load
   - Scrape the data
   - Navigate to the energy/battery details
   - Scrape the data
   - Go back to main screen
   - Open mileage details
   - Scrape the data
   - Send it to Home Assistant
   - Return to your previous app

5. Check Home Assistant Developer Tools → States to verify new sensors were created.


## Below instructions are unchanged from main english repo, some stuff may be different.

### Step 3: Add Dashboard 

#### 3.1 Create a New Dashboard View

1. In Home Assistant, go to your dashboard
2. Click the three dots → "Edit Dashboard"
3. Click "Add View"
4. Switch to "YAML mode"
5. Paste the contents of `dashboard.yaml`
6. Save

#### 3.2 Adjust Sensor Names (if needed)

If you changed `ha_sensor_name` in Step 2.2, you'll need to update the dashboard:

- Replace all instances of `sensor.leapmotor_c10_1` with your custom sensor name
- Replace all instances of derived sensors accordingly:
  - `sensor.leapmotor_c10_battery_1`
  - `sensor.leapmotor_c10_range_1`
  - `sensor.leapmotor_c10_car_temperature_1`
  - `sensor.leapmotor_c10_air_temperature_1`
  - `sensor.leapmotor_c10_lock_state_1`

## How It Works

### MacroDroid Automation

**Trigger:**

- Screen turns off (to avoid interrupting active use)

**Constraints:**

- Device is unlocked
- Macro hasn't run in the last 30 minutes

**Actions:**

1. Saves the current foreground app
2. Launches the Leapmotor app
3. Waits for the "energy" screen to load (loops up to 20 times)
4. Reads screen contents and extracts:
   - Air temperature
   - Car temperature
   - Lock state
   - Remaining range
   - Car state
5. Clicks on the battery indicator to view battery percentage
6. Waits for battery screen to load (loops up to 20 times)
7. Extracts battery percentage
8. Constructs JSON payload with all data
9. Sends POST request to Home Assistant REST API
10. Kills the Leapmotor app
11. Returns to the original app

### Data Flow

```
Leapmotor App (Android)
         ↓ (screen scraping)
   MacroDroid Macro
         ↓ (HTTP POST)
Home Assistant REST API
         ↓ (creates/updates)
sensor.leapmotor_c10_1
         ↓ (attributes extracted)
Template Sensors (battery, range, temps, lock state)
         ↓ (displayed on)
   Lovelace Dashboard
```

## Data Structure

The main sensor (`sensor.leapmotor_c10_1`) stores data in this format:

```json
{
  "state": "parked",
  "attributes": {
    "battery_percent": 85,
    "air_temp": 12,
    "car_temp": 18,
    "lock_state": "locked",
    "remaining_range": 340,
    "friendly_name": "Leapmotor C10",
    "icon": "mdi:car-electric"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Macro doesn't run automatically

- Check that the device is unlocked when the screen turns off
- Verify the "Last Run Time" constraint (30 minutes) hasn't blocked it
- Check MacroDroid logs: Menu → Log → Macro Log

### "Connection refused" or HTTP errors

- Verify `ha_url` is correct and accessible from your Android device
- Test by opening the URL in a browser on the same device
- Check that the access token is valid in Home Assistant
- Ensure Home Assistant is not behind a firewall blocking your device

### Sensors show "unknown" or "unavailable"

- Check that the macro has run at least once successfully
- Verify sensor names in `sensor.yaml` match the main sensor ID
- Check Home Assistant logs for template errors
- Ensure the main sensor exists: Developer Tools → States

### Macro fails to scrape data

- The Leapmotor app may have updated its UI elements
- Check the macro logs to see where it fails
- You may need to update the UI element IDs in the macro
- Ensure the Leapmotor app is logged in and working

### Dashboard cards not loading

- Install all required HACS integrations (see Prerequisites)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

## Customization

### Update Frequency

The macro runs when:

- Screen turns off
- Device is unlocked
- At least 30 minutes have passed since last run

To change the frequency:

1. Edit the macro
2. Find "Constraint: Last Run Time"
3. Adjust the time period

### Add More Sensors

If you want to track additional data from the Leapmotor app:

1. Edit the macro
2. Add screen scraping actions for the new data points
3. Update the JSON payload in the "Set Variable: ha_request_body" action
4. Add corresponding template sensors in `sensor.yaml`
5. Update the dashboard to display the new sensors

### Dashboard Styling

The dashboard uses [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) for styling. Adjust:

- Card widths (default: 162px)
- Colors (in `icon_color` templates)
- Thresholds (battery warnings, range warnings, etc.)

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data

The macro handles sensitive information:

- **Home Assistant access token** - Stored securely in MacroDroid
- **Home Assistant URL** - Stored securely in MacroDroid

**Important:**

- Both are marked as "secure" variables in MacroDroid
- They are encrypted in the MacroDroid database
- The exported `.macro` file contains empty placeholders only
- Never share your configured macro file publicly
- Regenerate your access token if compromised

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for your Home Assistant URL when possible
- Consider using Nabu Casa for secure remote access
- If using local HTTP, ensure your WiFi network is secure
- The access token grants full API access - treat it like a password

## Known Limitations

- Requires Android device with MacroDroid
- Only updates when device screen turns off
- Requires Leapmotor app to be installed and logged in
- Screen scraping is fragile and may break with app updates
- No real-time updates (updates every 30+ minutes)
- Device must be unlocked for macro to run
- Cannot control vehicle functions (read-only integration)

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:

- Support for multiple Leapmotor vehicles
- More frequent updates (with battery optimization)
- Additional data points (odometer, tire pressure, etc.)
- Notifications for low battery or unlock events
- Historical data tracking and charts
